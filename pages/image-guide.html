                <h2>A Guide for Choosing Image File Types</h2>
            <p>As a graphic designer, you want to ensure the best image quality across all channels and devices, without slowing down the page load time. JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF… There are so many formats to choose from. So which formats are suitable for logos, navigation menu icons, and printed material? What are the pros and the cons of these formats?</p>
            <h3>File Types</h3>
            <h4>JPEG</h4>
            <p>The JPEG file format is the most common file extensions for images, which was created in 1992 by the Joint Photographic Experts Groups. JPEG is a lossy compression for digital images. The compression used is the discrete cosine transform, which converts the frame into a 2D domain through a mathematical process.</p>

            <p>Due to the lossy compression method, the images lose their quality when edited and saved multiple times. Software tools give the user the option to choose how much the image should be compressed. JPEG isn’t suited for logos or icons, which require proper scaling possibilities. JPEGs are perfect for color-rich photos, and images with blending color tones.

                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <h4>GIF</h4>
            <p>When we think about GIF, the first thing that comes to mind are funny animated images. The Graphic Interchange Format is a bitmap video format created in 1987 by Steve Wilhite. The lossless data compression is established through the Lempel–Ziv–Welch algorithm. The algorithm encodes 8-bit data at fixed-length 12-bit codes.</p>

            <p>Due to the 24-bit RGB color support (up to 256 colors), the GIF-extension isn’t suitable for color-rich photographs. Graphics with solid colors are recommended for this file type. Since the GIF extension is pretty old, it’s not really suitable for modern usage. Nevertheless, the file type is still used for banner ads, but is being replaced by more dynamic HTML-5 formats.</p>

                <tr>

                    <th> File Name</th>
                    <th> Tips</th>

                <tr>

                    <td> <img src="../img/boston960x720.gif" alt="Boston Lake LARGE"></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <h4>PNG</h4>
            <p>The PNG (Portable Network Graphics) extension is an improved version of GIF extension. Since the GIF had limited capabilities, the PNG format was introduced. The limited color support of GIF was one of the reasons why PNG was developed. Computers became more advanced and were able to create a wider variety of colors.</p>

            <p>PNG images are compressed in two stages, the pre-compression stage and the lossless data compression stage, called DEFLATE. This method, which delays the compression process, does not decrease the file size, making it bigger than the more aggressive compression in the lossy JPEG format.</p>

           <p>PNG and JPEG do not differ much in quality when it comes to detail-rich photographs. However, the file size of PNG is much bigger. PNG is, therefore, best used for images which contain areas with a lot of solid color and sharp transitions.</p>
